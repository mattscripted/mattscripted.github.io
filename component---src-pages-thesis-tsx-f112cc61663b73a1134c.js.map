In such instances, a\n          game's subsuming feature—its storyline—is disrupted, as the predefined set of valid event\n          sequences—events being uninterruptable units of functionality that further the game's story—is\n          not honoured, as per the game designers' intentions. We postulate that sequence breaking often\n          arises through bypassing geographic barriers, cheating, and misunderstanding on the player's behalf.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Throughout this dissertation, we present an approach to preventing sequence breaking at\n          run-time with the help of Use Case Maps. We create a \"narrative manager\" and traversal\n          algorithm to monitor the player's narrative progress and check the legality of attempted\n          event calls. We verify our solution through test cases and show its feasibility through a\n          game, concluding that our solution is sufficient and feasible.\n        </p>\n      </blockquote>\n\n      <p>\n        As part of this thesis, I implemented a testing tool to verify my solution and created a\n        simple game called <strong>Dungeon Explorer</strong> to demonstrate that I could indeed\n        prevent sequence breaking at run-time:\n      </p>\n      {/* These links will not work in development due to a Gatsby bug */}\n      <ul>\n        <li>\n          <a href='/thesis/ucm-testing-tool.htm'>Interactive Testing Tool</a>\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          <a href='/thesis/dungeon-explorer.htm'>Dungeon Explorer</a>\n        </li>\n      </ul>\n\n      <h2>Testing Tool</h2>\n      <p>For details on the testing tool, please refer to chapter 4 of my thesis.</p>\n\n      <h2>Dungeon Explorer</h2>\n      <p>\n        In Dungeon Explorer, the player navigates a simple dungeon, wherein they collect coins (yelllow circles).\n        As visibility is limited, torches (orange triangles) can be gathered to increase the light. By progressing\n        through the dungeon, by activating switches, more areas become accessible. Once all coins have been found\n        the player can leave the dungeon, having beaten the game.\n      </p>\n\n      <h3>Controls</h3>\n      <ul>\n        <li>\n          Press <strong>Z</strong> to close text messages\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          Use the arrow keys to move around\n        </li>\n      </ul>\n\n      <h3>Cheats</h3>\n      <p>\n        Where Dungeon Explorer gets interesting is that the player can cheat in attempt to activate switches,\n        which should not be accessible. Attempting to step on an 'illegal' switch will result in sequence breaking\n        being detected, prevented, and, to a lesser extent, resolved.\n      </p>\n      <ul>\n        <li>\n          Press <strong>Q</strong> to toggle light\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          Press <strong>W</strong> to walk through barriers\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          Press <strong>E</strong> to force switches to enabled (and thus ready to activate)\n        </li>\n      </ul>\n      <p>\n        For further details, please refer to chapter 4 of my thesis.
