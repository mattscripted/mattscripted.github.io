But honestly, outside of work, I really struggle to complete my personal goals and projects.</p>\n<p>Earlier in the year, I tried out Marie Kondo’s “Tidying Up” method. Y’know, the <a href=\"https://konmari.com/category/konmari-philosophy/\">“Does it spark joy?”</a> <sup>1</sup> one. I cleaned up most of my home. Then, I took five months to finally put up some picture frames. Five months!</p>\n<p>I wish I could say this incident was just a one-off case, but in reality I often fall behind on my personal to-do list.</p>\n<p>Frustrated with my lack of progress on personal goals and projects lately, I decided to dive fully into David Allen’s <a href=\"https://gettingthingsdone.com/what-is-gtd/\">Getting Things Done</a> <sup>2</sup> methodology.</p>\n<p>It’s been great. Heck, it’s even fun! And yes, I am getting things done.</p>\n<h2>What is Getting Things Done?</h2>\n<p>Roughly speaking, Getting Things Done <sup>2</sup> is a general approach to, well, getting things done. Here is how I applied it.</p>\n<h3>Horizons of Focus <sup>3</sup></h3>\n<p>I began with my purpose, and broke things down by <a href=\"https://gettingthingsdone.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/2016-Levels-of-Your-Work.pdf\">horizons of focus</a> <sup>3</sup>, until I reached actionable items I could do within a day.</p>\n<p>For the first three horizons of focus—Purpose, Vision, and Goals—I used Simon Sinek’s Golden Circle from <a href=\"https://youtu.be/IPYeCltXpxw\">Start with Why</a> <sup>4</sup>.</p>\n<h4>Purpose</h4>\n<p>“Why do [I] do what [I] do?” <sup>4</sup></p>\n<p>What makes me a great friend, co-worker, or leader? What gets me out of bed in the morning? What can I offer to others?</p>\n<p><em>Ex. To support others through self-improvement.</em></p>\n<h4>Vision</h4>\n<p>“How do [I] do it?” <sup>4</sup> What does life look like when I do it?</p>\n<p><em>Ex. I am a Technical Lead who builds great software and great software developers.</em></p>\n<h4>Goals</h4>\n<p>What do I do? <sup>4</sup> What are my specific goals and objectives?</p>\n<p><em>Ex. I am a Technical Lead or equivalent. I lead a team.</em></p>\n<h4>Focus and Accountability</h4>\n<p>What do I need to do to keep things running smoothly?</p>\n<p><em>Ex. I eat well and exercise everyday. I maintain a 3-month emergency fund.</em></p>\n<h4>Projects</h4>\n<p>What can I complete within one year that requires more than one action?</p>\n<p><em>Ex. Incorporate Test-Driven Development into my workflow.</em></p>\n<h4>Ground</h4>\n<p>What actions can I do in less than one day to move a project forward?</p>\n<p><em>Ex. Read an article on Test-Driven Development.</em></p>\n<h3>Inbox <sup>2</sup></h3>\n<p>I collect everything that comes to mind, such as requests from others or things I want / need to do. I get things out of my head as quickly as possible.</p>\n<h3>Someday Maybe <sup>5</sup></h3>\n<p>Often, there will be things I want to do that are not a priority right now. I keep them in a <a href=\"https://gettingthingsdone.com/2010/10/what-goes-on-a-someday-maybe-list/\">Someday Maybe list</a> <sup>5</sup>, and pull them forward when I can.</p>\n<h3>Reference Material <sup>2</sup></h3>\nReference materials are non-actionable information, like notes or documents.\n<h3>Workflow <sup>2</sup></h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Capture</strong> what comes to mind in an inbox</li>\n<li><strong>Clarify</strong> if it’s worth doing, what it means, and how to push it forward</li>\n<li><strong>Organize</strong> items where they belong</li>\n<li><strong>Reflect</strong> on horizons of focus from time to time</li>\n<li><strong>Engage</strong> by working through actions</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>What's the next action? <sup>2</sup></h3>\n<p>Asking, “What’s the next action?” will push projects forward.</p>\n<p>Thus, completing actions brings projects one step closer to being done. And, completing projects brings goals one step closer to being done. And, so on.</p>\n<p>When I complete actions, I move one step closer to my purpose.</p>\n<h2>Here’s an Example</h2>\n<p>One day, another developer introduces me to Test-Driven Development. It sounds pretty cool, but I’m not sure how to use it in my workflow.</p>\n<p>First, I <strong>capture</strong> “Look into Test-Driven Development” in my inbox.</p>\n<p>Second, I <strong>clarify</strong> what it means to “Look into Test-Driven Development.” Is it worth doing? Is it a single action or a project? Is it reference material?</p>\n<p>I see that it’s a project, so I build out the idea a bit more:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">- I have read a few articles on Test-Driven Development (TDD)\n- I understand the benefits and drawbacks of TDD\n- I understand when to use TDD and when not to use TDD\n- I can explain what TDD is to someone else\n- I have written a small feature following TDD</code></pre></div>\n<p>All of a sudden, this vague idea of “Look into Test-Driven Development” means something. I understand what I want out of it.</p>\n<p>Further, by clarifying, I find some next actions:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">- Read at least 3 articles on Test-Driven Development (TDD)\n- Summarize the benefits and drawbacks of TDD\n- Build a feature using TDD</code></pre></div>\n<p>Third, I <strong>organize</strong> the project and its actions.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, my current projects and next actions are filled with important work. So, I add the items to my Someday Maybe list.</p>\n<p>Fourth, I <strong>reflect</strong> on my current projects, next actions, and Someday Maybe list to adjust priorities from time to time.</p>\n<p>After a few weeks, it looks like I can work on my Test-Driven Development project now. I pull the work forward into my current projects and next actions.</p>\n<p>Finally, I <strong>engage</strong> by doing my next actions.</p>\n<h2>My Getting Things Done Setup</h2>\n<p>Putting everything together, I use Trello, Google Calendar, and Google Drive. I found <a href=\"https://blog.trello.com/gtd-getting-things-done-maximizing-productivity-trello\">Daniel Chait’s approach with Trello</a> <sup>6</sup> very helpful.</p>\n<p>Trello tells me what things to do. It includes my Inbox, Someday Maybe, Purpose, Vision, Goals, Focus and Accountability, Current Projects, Next Actions, and Done lists. I also added Blocked / Waiting For and Doing lists to track the state of in-progress actions.</p>\n<p>Google Calendar tells me when to do things. It includes my recurring activities, like washing laundry, and upcoming actions, like appointments. As I plan out each day, I schedule time in my calendar.</p>\n<p>Google Drive stores reference material in alphabetical folders. Initially, I started with a single folder called A - Z, then broke it into two folders of A - M and N - Z, and then into four folders of A - G, H - N, O - U, and V - Z. With these folders, it is pretty quick to find things.</p>\n<p>Eventually, I added a “Projects” folder next to “Reference Material” with the same alphabetical folders. It separates projects, like presentations, from notes and documents, to reduce clutter.</p>\n<p>I tried to keep this system as simple as possible, so I could evolve it over time. It’s not fancy, but it’s easy to use and helps me get things done.</p>\n<h2>Get Things Done</h2>\n<p>If you have struggled to reach your professional or personal goals or projects, I recommend trying the <a href=\"https://gettingthingsdone.com/what-is-gtd/\">Getting Things Done</a> <sup>2</sup> methodology. A little bit of setup, clarification, and figuring out next actions may help you get more things done.</p>\n<h2>References</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>KonMari Media Inc, <a href=\"https://konmari.com/category/konmari-philosophy/\">KonMari Philosophy</a></li>\n<li>David Allen Company, <a href=\"https://gettingthingsdone.com/what-is-gtd/\">Getting Things Done</a></li>\n<li>David Allen Company, <a href=\"https://gettingthingsdone.com/what-is-gtd/\">Horizons of Focus</a></li>\n<li>Simon Sinek, <a href=\"https://youtu.be/IPYeCltXpxw\">Start with Why</a></li>\n<li>GTD Forum, <a href=\"https://gettingthingsdone.com/2010/10/what-goes-on-a-someday-maybe-list/\">What goes on a Someday Maybe list?</a></li>\n<li>Daniel Chait, <a href=\"https://blog.trello.com/gtd-getting-things-done-maximizing-productivity-trello\">The GTD Approach To Maximizing Productivity With Trello</a></li>\n</ol>","frontmatter":{"title":"Applying the Getting Things Done Methodology","date":"July 22, 2020","description":"Getting more done, one next action at a time."}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/getting-things-done/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/restful-guide-to-apis/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"A RESTful Guide to APIs"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/student-loans/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Paying off My Student Loans"}}}}}
