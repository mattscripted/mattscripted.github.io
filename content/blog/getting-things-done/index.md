I try to stay organized, keep on top of everything, and accomplish what I set out to do. But honestly, outside of work, I really struggle to complete my personal goals and projects.

Earlier in the year, I tried out Marie Kondo's "Tidying Up" method. Y'know, the "Does it spark joy?" one. I cleaned up a ton of stuff. Then, I took five months to finally put up some picture frames. Five months!

Frustrated with my lack of progress on personal goals and projects lately, I decided to dive fully into the "Getting Things Done" methodology.

It's been great. Heck, it's even fun!

And yes, I am getting things done.

## What is Getting Things Done?
Roughly speaking, [Getting Things Done](https://gettingthingsdone.com/what-is-gtd/) is a general approach to, well, getting things done. Here is how I understand it.

### Horizons of Focus
We begin from the highest level of our being, and break things down smaller and smaller until we reach actionable work. These are [horizons of focus](https://gettingthingsdone.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/2016-Levels-of-Your-Work.pdf).

#### Purpose and Principles
Why do I do what I do?

*Ex. To support others through self-improvement.*

#### Vision
How do I do what I do? What does life look like when I do it?

*Ex. I am a Technical Lead who builds great software and great software developers.*

#### Goals
What do I want to do? What are my specific goals and objectives?

*Ex. I am a Technical Lead or equivalent. I lead a team.*

#### Areas of Focus and Accountability
What do I need to do to keep things running smoothly?

*Ex. I eat well and exercise everyday. I maintain a 3-month emergency fund.*

#### Projects
What can I complete within one year that requires more than one action?

*Ex. Implement Test-Driven Development into my workflow.*

#### Ground
What actions can I do in less than one day to move a goal or project forward?

*Ex. Read an article on Test-Driven Development.*

### Someday Maybe
Often, there will be things I want to do, but are simply lower priority. I keep them in a "Someday Maybe" wishlist, and pull them forward when I can.

### Reference Material
Reference materials are non-actionable information, like notes or documents.

### Workflow
1. **Capture** what comes to mind in an inbox
2. **Clarify** if it's worth doing, what it means, and how to push it forward
3. **Organize** items where they belong
4. **Reflect** on horizons of focus from time to time
5. **Engage** by working through actions

### What's the next action?
Asking, "What's the next action?" will push projects forward.

Thus, completing actions brings projects one step closer to being done. And, completing projects brings goals one step closer to being done. And, so on.

When we complete actions, we move one step closer to our purpose.

## Here's an Example
One day, I overhear some developers talking about Test-Driven Development. It sounds pretty cool, but I'm not sure how to use it in my workflow.

First, I **capture** "Look into Test-Driven Development" in my inbox.

Second, I **clarify** what it means to "Look into Test-Driven Development." Is it worth doing? Is it a single action or a projet? Is it reference material?

I see that it's a project, so I build out the idea a bit more:

```
- I have read a few articles on Test-Driven Development (TDD)
- I understand the benefits and drawbacks of TDD
- I understand when to use TDD and when not to use TDD
- I can explain what TDD is to someone else
- I have written a small feature following TDD
```

All of a sudden, this vague idea of "Look into Test-Driven Development" means something. I understand what I want out of it.

Further, by clarifying, I find some next actions:

```
- Read at least 3 articles on Test-Driven Development (TDD)
- Summarize the benefits and drawbacks of TDD
- Build a feature using TDD
```

Third, I **organize** the project and its actions.

Unfortunately, my current projects and next actions are filled with important work. So, I add the items to my "Someday Maybe" list.

Fourth, I **reflect** on my current projects, next actions, and "Someday Maybe" list to adjust priorities from time to time.

After a few weeks, it looks like I can work on my Test-Driven Development project now. I pull the work forward into my current projects and next actions.

Finally, I **engage** by doing my next actions.

## My Getting Things Done Setup

Putting everything together, I use Trello, Google Calendar, and Google Drive. I found [Daniel Chait's approach with Trello](https://blog.trello.com/gtd-getting-things-done-maximizing-productivity-trello) very helpful.

Trello contains my Inbox, Someday Maybe, Purpose, Vision, Goals, Focus and Accountability, Current Projects, Next Actions, and Done lists. I also added "Blocked / Waiting For" and "Doing" to track the state of next actions.

Google Calendar tells me when to do things. It contains recurring reminders and activities, like washing laundry or ordering groceries. As I plan out my day, I include some next actions.

Google Drive stores "Reference Material" in alphabetical folders. Initially, I started with a single folder called A - Z, then broke it into two folders of A - M and N - Z, and then into four folders of A - G, H - N, O - U, and V - Z. With these folders, it is pretty quick to find things.

Eventually, I created a "Projects" folder next to "Reference Material" with the same alphabetical folders. It separates projects, like presentations, from notes and documents, to reduce clutter.

I tried to keep this system as simple as possible, so I could evolve it over time.

## Get Things Done

If you have struggled to reach your professional or personal goals, I recommend trying [Getting Things Done](https://gettingthingsdone.com/what-is-gtd/). A little bit of setup, some clarification, and figuring out what comes next may help you get more things done.
